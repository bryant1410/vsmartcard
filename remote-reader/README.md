# Remote Smart Card Reader

Allow a host computer to use the smartphone's NFC hardware as contact-less
smartcard reader. On the host computer a special smart card driver,
[vpcd](http://frankmorgner.github.io/vsmartcard/virtualsmartcard/README.html),
must be installed. The app establishes a connection to vpcd over the network
when a contact-less card is detected.

Please refer to [our project's website](http://frankmorgner.github.io/vsmartcard/remote-reader/README.html) for more information.
